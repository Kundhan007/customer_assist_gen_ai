## Environment Variables

The collection uses the following environment variables:

- `jwt_token`: JWT token for authentication (automatically set after login)

### Setting Up Environment Variables

1. In Postman, click on the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) in the top right corner
2. Go to "Variables" tab
3. Set the `base_url` to your API endpoint (default is `http://localhost:3001`)

## Authentication Flow

1. **Start with Login**: Run either "Login - Admin User" or "Login - Regular User"
2. **Token Storage**: The login request automatically stores the JWT token in the `jwt_token` variable
3. **Use Token**: All subsequent requests will automatically use the stored token for authentication
